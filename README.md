University Project for Autonomous Systems in NodeJS and Python - course of Computer Engineering at University of Minho.

## So, what is this?
This project is the second subject of Autonomous Systems where we focus on collecting data using virtual sensors and use Machine Learning techniques with that data so we can predict future incidents.
The web page is made in NodeJS where we collect traffic incidents data from a established area in Porto using the TomTom Traffic API and we display it using graphs tables and maps.
